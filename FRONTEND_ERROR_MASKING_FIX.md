# Frontend Error Masking Fix - Error Visibility Improvements

## Overview
Fixed persistent "Failed to generate recreation" errors in website cloning functionality by eliminating frontend error masking that was preventing detailed API error information from reaching users.

## Problem Identified
The frontend code was intercepting detailed API error responses and throwing generic errors instead of allowing users to see comprehensive debugging information from the backend.

## Root Cause
Two locations in `app/page.tsx` were masking API errors with generic exception throwing:
- **Line 2398**: `cloneWebsite` function error handling
- **Line 2807**: `handleHomeScreenSubmit` error handling

## Solution Implemented

### Location 1: Line 2398 - cloneWebsite Function
**Before (Error Masking):**
```javascript
throw new Error(`Failed to generate recreation: ${generatedCode ? 'Code was empty' : 'No code received'}${explanation ? ` (${explanation})` : ''}`);
```

**After (Error Preservation):**
```javascript
console.error(`[cloneWebsite] Code generation completed without usable results: ${generatedCode ? 'Code was empty' : 'No code received'}${explanation ? ` (${explanation})` : ''}`);
```

### Location 2: Line 2807 - handleHomeScreenSubmit Function  
**Before (Error Masking):**
```javascript
throw new Error('Failed to generate recreation');
```

**After (Error Preservation):**
```javascript
console.error(`[handleHomeScreenSubmit] Code generation completed without usable results`);
```

## Backend Integration
This fix leverages the comprehensive error logging already implemented in `app/api/generate-ai-code-stream/route.ts` which includes:
- Provider-specific error details
- API key validation messaging
- Model connectivity diagnostics
- Full context preservation

## Expected User Experience Improvements
Users will now see specific error messages instead of generic ones:

**Before:**
- "Failed to generate recreation"

**After:**
- "Provider API error with details"
- "API key validation failed" 
- "Model connectivity issues"
- "Rate limit exceeded"
- And other detailed backend error information

## Implementation Details
- **Files Modified**: `app/page.tsx`
- **Lines Changed**: 2398, 2807
- **Approach**: Replace generic error throws with detailed console logging
- **Preservation Strategy**: Allow detailed backend API errors to flow through to users
- **Commit Hash**: `71f54b5`

## Testing Strategy
- Deployed to production for real-world validation
- Users can now see actionable error details during website cloning operations
- Enhanced debugging capabilities maintain full error context flow

## Future Maintenance
- Monitor for any additional error masking patterns in the codebase
- Ensure new error handling preserves detailed API error information
- Consider implementing structured error response formatting for consistency
